This is a sort of playground and journal of my experiences learning machine learing.

I am starting off with Andrej Karpathy's 'Zero to Hero' sequence.


## Micrograd

We're building a very basic neural net in Python, but instead of using tensors we're using scalars to keep it simple.

Important concept is derivatives, as we'll need to calculate the derivates of the input neurons with respect to the output. These derivatives relative to the output are known as gradients.
